## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A specific breakpoint in responsive design where layout adjustments occur often defined by media queries depending on screen size
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
provides more flexibility for elemebts to scale proportionally, adapting to different screen sizes in repsonsive layout
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
Smaller min-width wins due to the cascade and specificity of CSS ensuring more specific or later delcared styles take precedence.
